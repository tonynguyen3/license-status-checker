# License Status Checker

This is a TypeScript + Playwright rewrite of the Washington path from the old C# Selenium app.

## What It Does

The CLI reads an Excel workbook of Washington license holders, checks each license on Washington L&I, and writes:

- `Send-{date}.xlsx`
- `DoNotSend-{date}.xlsx`
- `coursesAlreadyTaken.xlsx`
- `expired.txt`
- `greaterThan90.txt`
- `exception.txt`

The bucketing rules match the old app:

- skip spreadsheet rows already expired
- skip spreadsheet rows more than 90 days out
- check the live L&I license page
- exclude invalid, non-active, or likely-renewed licenses
- map trade to CE hours:
  - `Plumber Trainee`: 8
  - `Plumber`: 16
  - `Electrician`: 24
- send active, near-expiration licenses with no completed CE credits
- do not send if any CE credits are already present

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run install:browsers
```

## Run

Put the source workbook at:

```text
Files/ListToCheck.xlsx
```

Then run:

```bash
npm start
```

Useful options:

```bash
npm start -- --input /path/to/ListToCheck.xlsx --out-dir /path/to/Files
npm start -- --headed
npm start -- --limit 10 --headed --slow-mo 100
```

`--headed` opens the browser visibly, which is helpful while validating selectors against the state website.

## Verify

```bash
npm run check
npm test
```

## Notes

The old C# app added records to an in-memory send list when the L&I page had no `Courses` section, but it did not write those rows to the Send spreadsheet. This rewrite writes all bucketed rows at the end, so those send rows are preserved.

The Playwright selectors still depend on Washington L&I's page structure, especially:

- `#ExpirationDate`
- `#StatusDescription strong`
- `#LicenseType`
- `#Courses`
- `#coursesList .itemSingleCol`
